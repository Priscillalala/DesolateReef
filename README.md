# Desolate Reef
![Stage Preview #1]("https://github.com/Priscillalala/FreeSkillSaturday/blob/master/thunderstore/texFreeItemFridayExpansionIcon.png?raw=true")
Do you like Void Locus? Do you play Eclipse, or hate the void-boss-who-shall-not-be-named? Then DESOLATE REEF is the mod for you!

Desolate Reef is a stage 2 that reimplements the Void Locus terrain with updated props, visuals, monsters, interactables, and more. This map replaces the void ending path. Desolate Reef requires Survivors of the Void to be played but is not tied to the SOTV expansion in the lobby.

## Mod Compatability
Desolate Reef is a reskinned Void Locus, so mods that affect Void Locus will likely affect Desolate Reef too. Please be aware of mod interactions, and report any critical conflicts to me and/or the mod authors.
